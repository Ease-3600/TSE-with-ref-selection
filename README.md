# TSE-with-ref-selection

target speaker extraction with speaker reference selection

## Dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prepare Dataset

```
git clone https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix.git
```

## Reference Selection

| Method                                                       | ACC(ov=30%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Speaker Diarization and use longest segments                 | 86.0        |
| Split into 5s chunks and clustering                          | 79.5        |
| Overlap detection and clustering with 5s sliding window      | 99.5        |
| Split into regions, overlap detection and clustering with regions | 89.2        |

## Speaker Extraction
